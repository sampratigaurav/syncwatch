## 2024-05-14 - ReactionButton Inline Styles
**Learning:** React components using inline `<style>` tags for animations (e.g. `@keyframes`) inject redundant global styles into the DOM on every render.
**Action:** Always move `@keyframes` and other non-scoped CSS rules from component inline `<style>` blocks to global stylesheets (like `index.css`) to reduce DOM bloat and layout thrashing.
## 2024-05-15 - Zustand useRoomStore() Default Subscriptions
**Learning:** Components calling `useRoomStore()` without a selector implicitly subscribe to the entire store. Because `latencyMs` updates every 10 seconds via socket pings, *any* component calling `useRoomStore()` re-renders globally every 10 seconds, causing unnecessary layout recalculations and react tree traversal.
**Action:** Always use `useShallow` with an explicit selector for Zustand stores in heavy components (like `Room.tsx` or `VideoPlayer.tsx`) to isolate re-renders to only the properties the component actually consumes.
## 2024-05-18 - Intl.DateTimeFormat instantiation in Render Loop
**Learning:** Instantiating `Intl.DateTimeFormat` inside a component's render loop or a helper function called during render (like formatting message timestamps) is an expensive operation that degrades performance, especially in list rendering components like Chat that re-render frequently.
**Action:** Always hoist and cache expensive initializations like `Intl.DateTimeFormat` outside of React components so they are created only once per module load.
